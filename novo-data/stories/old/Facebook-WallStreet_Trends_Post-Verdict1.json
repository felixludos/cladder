    "To add complexity, we introduce 'CovidDeltaConcern,' reflecting the level of public concern about the delta variant of the coronavirus. This variable influences both the 'LegalDecision' and 'PublicPerception' variables, creating interesting interactions.",
    "The 'EconomicEnvironment' variable serves as a confounder, representing the overall economic situation influenced by various factors. It affects both 'LegalDecision' and 'CovidDeltaConcern,' adding depth to our analysis.",
    "In the realm of media influence, 'MediaCoverage' plays a pivotal role, representing the nature and extent of media coverage on major events. It impacts both 'LegalDecision' and 'PublicPerception,' highlighting the importance of media in shaping public opinion.",
    "Two mediator variables, 'FacebookStockResponse' and 'PublicPerception,' provide insights into how the legal decision, media coverage, and public concern collectively affect Facebook's stock response and the public's perception of the economic situation.",
    "Finally, 'StockMarketTrend' and 'InvestorConfidence' complete our causal graph. 'StockMarketTrend' represents the trend in the stock market, while 'InvestorConfidence' reflects the confidence level of investors.
