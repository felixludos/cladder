The sentences should be ordered from describing the most noteworthy/surprising features of the graph to the most natural/intuitive features. Use an intuitive conversational style to describe the causal graph, and avoid using technical terms or jargon, but you can describe the variables and their relationships (including using terms like \"affects\", \"confounder\"/\"confounding\", \"mediator\"/\"mediates\") as long as you use them in a way that is understandable to a layperson. Refrain from mentioning words like \"causal inference\", \"model\", or \"variable\". Also, try to make the sentences flow together well, and avoid repeating yourself while still being thorough. Make sure not to mention the names or types of the variables in the graph, only what they represent to make the overview more natural.

For each of the templates fill in the blanks in the curly braces (and include 2-3 examples for each template, sorted from highest quality to least). Format your response as a JSON object. When replacing a key that ends in \"#\", make sure to include some examples for both values (0 and 1) that the variables can take.

It aims to provide insights into how different aspects such as industrial production and unemployment rates have played a role in shaping China's economic trajectory during this period.\",\n",
    "    \"overview\": \"Our causal graph is a simplified representation of the complex interplay between various economic factors. It includes variables like government policies, industrial production, and unemployment rates, each affecting the other in unique ways. For instance, government policies can be a confounder, affecting both unemployment and industrial production, while consumer confidence acts as a mediator, reflecting the impact of industrial changes on the overall economic growth.\",\n",
