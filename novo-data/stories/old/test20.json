a new stadium, has garnered significant attention. This situation presents an intriguing opportunity to explore how various decisions and factors might influence the city's development and economic landscape.", "overview": "Our exploration revolves around understanding how different elements like the decision to build a new stadium, the city's investment in infrastructure, and the economic climate of Rotterdam interact with each other. We're particularly interested in how these elements together impact the development of Feyenoord City and the local real estate market, keeping in mind that some factors can influence or be influenced by multiple elements in this scenario.", "questions": {"1": {"question": "Is the decision to build a new stadium in Rotterdam likely to have a negative impact on the city's development?", "answer": "yes", "explanation": "Building a new stadium is expected to negatively influence the city's development due to the significant resources and focus it requires, potentially diverting attention and funds from other developmental aspects.", "wrong_explanation": "Building a new stadium is expected to positively influence the city's development as it can attract more visitors and investment, boosting the overall growth."}, "2": {"question": "Does investing more in the city's infrastructure positively impact Feyenoord City's development?", "answer": "yes", "explanation": "Increased investment in infrastructure by the municipality is likely to have a positive impact on Feyenoord City's development, enhancing accessibility and attractiveness of the area.", "wrong_explanation": "Increased investment in infrastructure might overburden the city's budget, leaving fewer resources for the development of Feyenoord City."}, "3": {"question": "Is the impact of investing in infrastructure on Feyenoord City's development lesser than that of the decision to build a new stadium?", "answer": "yes", "explanation": "The decision to build a new stadium likely has a more substantial impact on the city's development than infrastructure investment, given its scale and the attention it draws.", "wrong_explanation": "Investing in infrastructure is expected to have a more significant impact on the city's development than the stadium construction, as it affects a broader range of city areas and services."}, "4": {"question": "Is the absolute impact of the stadium decision on Feyenoord City's development greater than that of the municipality's investment in infrastructure?", "answer": "yes", "explanation": "The decision to build or not build a new stadium has a more pronounced and direct impact on the city's development compared to the more distributed and less visible effects of infrastructure investment.", "wrong_explanation": "The municipality's investment in infrastructure is likely to have a more far-reaching and significant impact on the city's development than the decision related to a single stadium project."}, "5": {"question": "When Rotterdam's economic climate is unfavorable, does the decision to build a new stadium still positively impact Feyenoord City's development?", "answer": "yes", "explanation": "Even in a challenging economic climate, the construction of a new stadium could provide a positive boost to Feyenoord City's development through increased attention and potential economic stimulation.",

"In a challenging economic climate, does increasing the city's infrastructure investment positively impact Feyenoord City's development?", "answer": "yes", "explanation": "Enhancing infrastructure investment during tough economic times can provide a positive lift to the city's development by improving essential services and accessibility.", "wrong_explanation": "When the economic climate is negative, additional investment in infrastructure might not be effective due to financial constraints and reduced overall economic activity."}, "7": {"question": "In an unfavorable economic climate, does the decision to build a new stadium have a greater positive impact on Feyenoord City's development compared to increasing infrastructure investment?", "answer": "yes", "explanation": "The construction of a new stadium is likely to have a more noticeable and immediate positive effect on the city's development than infrastructure investment, especially in a challenging economic

development."}, "8": {"question": "Is the absolute impact of increasing infrastructure investment in a challenging economic climate less than that of deciding to build a new stadium?", "answer": "yes", "explanation": "The direct and visible impact of a new stadium construction tends to overshadow the more subtle, yet essential, benefits of infrastructure investment, especially in an unfavorable economic setting.", "wrong_explanation": "Infrastructure investment, even in a difficult economic climate, can have a more significant and lasting impact on the city's development compared to the one-off decision of building a stadium."}, "9": {"question": "When Rotterdam's economic climate is favorable, does the decision to build a new stadium still positively impact Feyenoord City's development?", "answer": "yes", "explanation": "In a positive economic environment, the construction of a new stadium can complement the city's growth momentum, adding to the overall development of Feyenoord City.", "wrong_explanation": "With a thriving economy, resources spent on a new stadium might be seen as redundant or less impactful for the city's development."}, "10": {"question": "In a favorable economic climate, does increasing the city's infrastructure investment negatively impact Feyenoord City's development?", "answer": "no", "explanation": "Infrastructure investment in a

infrastructure on Feyenoord City's development lesser than that of the decision to build a new stadium?", "answer": "yes", "explanation": "The construction of a new stadium typically represents a landmark development, having a more pronounced impact on the city's growth than infrastructure investment, even in good economic times.", "wrong_explanation": "In a favorable economic climate, the systematic improvements from infrastructure investment could be more influential for the city's development than a single large-scale project like a stadium."}, "12": {"question": "Is the absolute impact of infrastructure investment in a favorable economic climate greater than that of the stadium decision?", "answer": "no", "explanation": "Even in a healthy economy, the tangible and high-profile nature of a new stadium construction often has a more immediate and visible impact compared to the gradual benefits of infrastructure investment.", "wrong_explanation": "In a positive economic setting, the strategic importance and widespread benefits of infrastructure investment can surpass the impact of a new stadium project on the city's development."}, "13": {"question": "Does the decision to build a new stadium have a greater positive impact on Feyenoord City's development in a favorable economic climate compared to an unfavorable one?", "answer": "yes", "explanation": "A new stadium, built in a thriving economic environment, is likely to complement and amplify the city's existing growth, making its impact more significant compared to during economic downturns.",

prosperity."}, "14": {"question": "Is the impact of building a new stadium more significant in an unfavorable economic climate compared to a favorable one?", "answer": "no", "explanation": "The positive effects of a new stadium are typically more pronounced in a healthy economic environment, where it can add to existing growth, rather than in a struggling economy.", "wrong_explanation": "In

increasing infrastructure investment more beneficial for Feyenoord City's development during economic hardship than in times of economic prosperity?", "answer": "no", "explanation": "Infrastructure investment tends to yield better results in a positive economic climate, where it can build on existing momentum, rather than in times of economic struggle.", "wrong_explanation": "During economic downturns, focused investment in infrastructure might be critical to sustaining or kick-starting the city's development, making it more beneficial than in times of prosperity."}, "16": {"question": "Is the impact of increased infrastructure investment more substantial in a favorable economic climate compared to an unfavorable one?", "answer": "yes", "explanation": "The benefits of increased infrastructure investment are typically more pronounced in a thriving economy, where they can leverage and enhance existing growth.", "wrong_explanation": "In a struggling economy, strategic
