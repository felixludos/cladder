Where possible, include relevant details from the original article headline or related information you can infer therefrom. Avoid discussing specific structural properties or assumptions in the causal graph, and instead focus on the overall motivation and potential applications for the model.
Make sure not to use any technical terms from causal inference so that the introduction is easy to understand even for a layperson, as if this were in a newspaper or casual discussion.
