Where possible, include relevant details from the original article headline. Avoid discussing specific structural properties or assumptions in the causal graph, and instead focus on the overall motivation and potential applications for the model. \n",

    "2. Write a short two sentence overview of the structure of the causal graph including noteworthy properties and assumptions. Use an intuitive conversational style to describe the causal graph, and avoid using technical terms or jargon, but you can describe the variables and their relationships (including using terms like \"confounder\"/\"confounding\", \"mediator\"/\"mediates\") as long as you explain them in a way that is understandable to a layperson.\n",

Make sure to formulate the question in an intuitive, yet precise manner and so that the correct answer is either \"yes\" or \"no\". Include the correct answer, and a brief 1 sentence explanation. Most importantly, include the formal ineqality that must be computed to get the correct answer (\"yes\"=True, \"no\"=False) (for example, if the ATE of treatment variable \"A\" is greater than the ATE of treatment variable \"B\", and the correct answer is \"yes\" and the inequality is \"ATE(A) > ATE(B)\", or if the question asks whether treatment variable \"A\" has a positive causal effect on the outcome variable, then the inequality is \"ATE(A) > 0\").

    "    \"introduction\": \"In light of China's notable economic growth of 4.9% amidst the global coronavirus pandemic, as reported by the Daily Mail, this causal model seeks to unravel the underlying factors contributing to this growth. It aims to provide insights into how different aspects such as industrial production and unemployment rates have played a role in shaping China's economic trajectory during this period.\",\n",
    "    \"overview\": \"Our causal graph is a simplified representation of the complex interplay between various economic factors. It includes variables like government policies, industrial production, and unemployment rates, each affecting the other in unique ways. For instance, government policies can be a confounder, affecting both unemployment and industrial production, while consumer confidence acts as a mediator, reflecting the impact of industrial changes on the overall economic growth.\",\n",
    "    \"questions\": {\n",
    "        1: {\"question\": \"Does an increase in industrial production have a positive effect on China's economic growth?\", \"answer\": \"yes\", \"explanation\": \"Given the economic context, an increase in industrial production likely contributes positively to economic growth.\", \"inequality\": \"ATE(IP) > 0\"},\n",
    "        2: {\"question\": \"Is the positive impact of decreasing unemployment on economic growth greater than that of increasing industrial production?\", \"answer\": \"no\", \"explanation\": \"Industrial production typically has a more direct and significant impact on economic growth compared to changes in unemployment rates.\", \"inequality\": \"ATE(UR) > ATE(IP)\"},\n",
    "        3: {\"question\": \"Does a decrease in the unemployment rate positively influence China's economic growth?\", \"answer\": \"yes\", \"explanation\": \"Lower unemployment generally leads to higher consumer spending and economic growth.\", \"inequality\": \"ATE(UR) > 0\"},\n",
    "        4: {\"question\": \"Is the impact of industrial production on economic growth stronger than the influence of government economic policies?\", \"answer\": \"yes\", \"explanation\": \"While government policies set the stage, industrial production is a more direct driver of economic growth.\", \"inequality\": \"ATE(IP) > ATE(GEP)\"},\n",
    "        5: {\"question\": \"Does a stimulative government policy have a greater positive effect on economic growth than an increase in industrial production?\", \"answer\": \"no\", \"explanation\": \"Industrial production, being a direct economic activity, likely has a stronger immediate impact on economic growth than general government policies.\", \"inequality\": \"ATE(GEP) > ATE(IP)\"}\n",
