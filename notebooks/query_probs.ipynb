By examining sales data of cigarettes and cigars from the past five years, including both menthol and non-menthol varieties, we can compare trends before and after the announcement.

The sentences should be ordered from describing the most noteworthy/surprising features of the graph to the most natural/intuitive features. Use an intuitive conversational style to describe the causal graph, and avoid using technical terms or jargon, but you can describe the variables and their relationships (including using terms like \"affects\", \"confounder\"/\"confounding\", \"mediator\"/\"mediates\") as long as you use them in a way that is understandable to a layperson. Refrain from mentioning words like \"causal inference\", \"model\", or \"variable\". Also, try to make the sentences flow together well, and avoid repeating yourself while still being thorough. Make sure not to mention the names or types of the variables in the graph, only what they represent to make the overview more natural.

    "    \"overview\": \"Our causal graph is a simplified representation of the complex interplay between various economic factors. It includes variables like government policies, industrial production, and unemployment rates, each affecting the other in unique ways.
