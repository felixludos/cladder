We have a causal bayes net based on the following article:

```
{spark}
```

Now we would like to estimate the probabilities of certain events.

Using commonsense, estimate the probabilities of the following events:

{prob_questions}

Where the variables are defined as:
{descriptions}

For each question above, answer with the lower and upper bound estimates of the probabilities as a python dictionary where the key corresponds to the question index in exactly the following format:

```python
probabilities = {{
  1: [0.3, 0.4],
  ...
}}
```

Answer concisely and precisely in the desired format.
