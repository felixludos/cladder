We have a statistical model based on the following topic:

{motivation["introduction"]}

Now we would like to use this model to generate the following interesting research questions. Verbalize interesting "yes"/"no" questions where the correct answer depends computation of each of the following quantities:

{query_description}

Where "| * |" is the absolute value and the definitions of "ATE('X')" (average treatment effect) and "CATE('X' | 'U'=u)" are:

ATE('X') = E['Y' | do('X' = 1)] - E['Y' | do('X' = 0)]
CATE('X' | 'U'=u) = E['Y' | 'U'=u, do('X' = 1)] - E['Y' | 'U'=u, do('X' = 0)]

Where 'X' is a treatment variable, 'Y' is the outcome variable, and 'U' is a confounder variable.

In addition to the questions and associated answers include a one sentence explanation for each question, and "wrong_explanation" which is just like the explanation but argues for the opposite answer. Make sure the explanations can stand on their own without the question, so they should include all important details from the question.

The meanings of all the variables (all of which are binary) in the statistical model are:

{variable_description}

Answer in the form of a json dictionary in the following format:

```json
{{
    "1": {{"question": "[question]", "answer": "yes", "explanation": "[explanation]", "wrong_explanation": "[wrong_explanation]"}},
    ...
}}
```
Answer concisely and precisely in the desired format. Do not add any additional comments or discussion. Most importantly, do not use any technical terms from causal inference such as ATE or CATE in the questions and explanations so that everything is easy to understand even for a layperson in a casual conversation.
