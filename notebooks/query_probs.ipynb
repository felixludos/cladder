    "    \"overview\": \"Our approach looks at how different factors like the curfew enforcement, public response, and healthcare capacity interplay with each other.

    "        1: {\"question\": \"Does implementing a curfew generally lead to better public health outcomes?\", \"answer\": \"yes\", \"explanation\": \"Implementing a curfew is likely to have a positive effect on public health by controlling the situation that necessitated the curfew.\", \"wrong_explanation\": \"Implementing a curfew might not significantly impact public health, as other factors could play a more dominant role.\"},\n",
    "        2: {\"question\": \"Is public non-compliance with a curfew typically associated with better public health outcomes?\", \"answer\": \"no\", \"explanation\": \"Public non-compliance with a curfew is generally not expected to contribute positively to public health outcomes.\", \"wrong_explanation\": \"Public non-compliance might actually lead to better public health outcomes as it indicates normalcy and lesser public panic.\"},\n",
    "        3: {\"question\": \"Is the positive impact on public health greater when a curfew is implemented than when the public complies with it?\", \"answer\": \"yes\", \"explanation\": \"The direct enforcement of a curfew is likely to have a stronger positive impact on public health than the variable level of public compliance.\", \"wrong_explanation\": \"Public compliance with the curfew could have a greater positive impact on public health than the mere implementation of the curfew.\"},\n",
    "        4: {\"question\": \"Do both the implementation of a curfew and the lack of public compliance have a combined negative effect on public health?\", \"answer\": \"no\", \"explanation\": \"While the lack of public compliance might negatively affect public health, the implementation of a curfew is expected to have a positive impact, which does not result in a combined negative effect.\", \"wrong_explanation\": \"The negative impacts of both non-compliance and curfew implementation may combine to deteriorate public health.\"},\n",
