    "    \"introduction\": \"In light of China's notable economic growth of 4.9% amidst the global coronavirus pandemic, as reported by the Daily Mail, this causal model seeks to unravel the underlying factors contributing to this growth. It aims to provide insights into how different aspects such as industrial production and unemployment rates have played a role in shaping China's economic trajectory during this period.\",\n",
    "    \"overview\": \"Our causal graph is a simplified representation of the complex interplay between various economic factors. It includes variables like government policies, industrial production, and unemployment rates, each affecting the other in unique ways. For instance, government policies can be a confounder, affecting both unemployment and industrial production, while consumer confidence acts as a mediator, reflecting the impact of industrial changes on the overall economic growth.\",\n",
    "    \"questions\": {\n",
    "        1: {\"question\": \"Does an increase in industrial production have a positive effect on China's economic growth?\", \"answer\": \"yes\", \"explanation\": \"Given the economic context, an increase in industrial production likely contributes positively to economic growth.\", \"inequality\": \"ATE(IP) > 0\"},\n",
    "        2: {\"question\": \"Is the positive impact of decreasing unemployment on economic growth greater than that of increasing industrial production?\", \"answer\": \"no\", \"explanation\": \"Industrial production typically has a more direct and significant impact on economic growth compared to changes in unemployment rates.\", \"inequality\": \"ATE(UR) > ATE(IP)\"},\n",
    "        3: {\"question\": \"Does a decrease in the unemployment rate positively influence China's economic growth?\", \"answer\": \"yes\", \"explanation\": \"Lower unemployment generally leads to higher consumer spending and economic growth.\", \"inequality\": \"ATE(UR) > 0\"},\n",
    "        4: {\"question\": \"Is the impact of industrial production on economic growth stronger than the influence of government economic policies?\", \"answer\": \"yes\", \"explanation\": \"While government policies set the stage, industrial production is a more direct driver of economic growth.\", \"inequality\": \"ATE(IP) > ATE(GEP)\"},\n",
    "        5: {\"question\": \"Does a stimulative government policy have a greater positive effect on economic growth than an increase in industrial production?\", \"answer\": \"no\", \"explanation\": \"Industrial production, being a direct economic activity, likely has a stronger immediate impact on economic growth than general government policies.\", \"inequality\": \"ATE(GEP) > ATE(IP)\"}\n",
