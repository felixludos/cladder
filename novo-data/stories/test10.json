Answer the following questions to design an interesting, simple, and most importantly realistic causal model from a news article.\n\nTo help understand the instructions here are some tips:\n- all variables are always binary and (at least in principle) measurable, so when creating and selecting variables, make sure it is reasonable to treat them as binary\n- whenever you propose a variable, make sure to define the meaning of each value it can take, and mention whether it is observable or not\n- outcome variables are always observable\n- treatment variables are always observable and intervenable, that means it must be possible to (at least in principle) change their value if desired\n- confounder variables may or may not be observable, and should always have at least two causal children (for example, a treatment and outcome variable) and no causal parents\n- mediator variables may or may not be observable, and should always have at least one causal parents (for example, a treatment variable) and at least one causal child (for example, the outcome variable)\n- collider variables may or may not be observable, and should always have at least two causal parents (for example, a treatment and outcome variable) and no causal children\n\nAnswer concisely and precisely in the desired format. Carefully complete each of these tasks in order.\n\n1. Write a short description of what the article is about and what causal model make inform the reasoning behind an argument the might make.\n2. Propose 1 outcome variable that the news article is either implicitly or explicitly addressing that people are most likely to be interested in studying, especially if people tend to have misconceptions about it\n3. Propose 2 treatment variables that either directly or indirectly affect the selected outcome variable and are the most interesting to study\n4. Propose 3 confounder variables that affect some reasonable combination of the outcome and treatment variables\n5. Propose 3 mediator variables that affect and are affected by some reasonable combination of any other variables\n6. Propose 2 collider variables that are affected by some reasonable combination of any other variables\n\nHere is the beginning of the new article:\n```\nTitle: MediaWorld Singles' Day, the price of Xiaomi Redmi Note 9S collapses - Everyeye Tech\nDescription: None\nOriginal Language: Italian\n```\n\nThe variables and causal graph should, where possible, use specific details such as names and locations mentioned in the article.

List all the edges in the causal graph, and make sure to mention which edges are observable and which are not.\n3. Provide a python list called `nodes` of all the nodes in the proposed graph.
