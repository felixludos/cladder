1. Select some combination of 3-5 of the suggested confounder, mediator, and collider variables, in addition to the treatment and outcome variables to construct a realistic and interesting causal graph. Important: Make sure the causal graph is a DAG and that no node has more than three parents!
2.  List all the edges in the causal graph, and make sure to mention which edges are observable and which are not.
3. Provide a python list called `nodes` of all the nodes in the proposed graph. For each node, provide the following information in the form of a python dict:
- `name`: the name of the variable
- `description`: a short description of the variable
- `type`: the type of the variable, which can be one of the following: `outcome`, `treatment`, `confounder`, `mediator`, `collider`
- `observed`: a boolean value indicating whether the variable is observable or not
- `values`: a python list of the descriptions of the values the variable can take (corresponding to the index)
- `parents`: a python list of the names of the parents of the variable (make sure they match the corresponding `name` field of the parent nodes, and remember, there should not be more than three parents for any node)

Take a deep breath and think step-by-step about how you will do this.
