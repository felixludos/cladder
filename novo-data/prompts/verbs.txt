We would like to find very natural verbalizations of the following binary variables selected from a statistical model. The verbalizations should sound more natural and organic, so that you could imagine them being used in a news paper article or casual conversation, while still being semantically equivalent to the original variable and value.

Here are the templates that we use to verbalize the variables:

1. One of the variables is {{variable}}.
2. We estimate {{subject}} [often/usually/sometimes/rarely/etc.] {{value}}.
3. There is a [number]% chance that {{value}}.
4. [number]% of {{domain}} {{value}}.
5. [number]% of the time {{value}}.
6. Conditional sentence: {{value}}, [some consequence].
7. Interventional: If {{value}}, [some effect].

{variable_description}

Here are some examples of verbalizations of the variable. For each of the templates fill in the blanks (and include 2-3 examples for each template). Format your response as a python dictionary. When replacing the key "value", make sure to include some examples for both values that the variables can take. For example, a variable "Smoking Rate" which takes the values "Low Smoking Rate"=0 and "High Smoking Rate"=1 can be verbalized like this:

```python
verbalizations = {{
  "Smoking Rate": {{
    1: {{"variable": ["the smoking rate", "proportion of smokers"]}},
    2: {{"subject": "people", "value": {{0: ["do not smoke", "are non-smokers"], 1: ["smoke", "are smokers"]}}}},
    3: {{"value": {{0: ["people do not smoke", "people are non-smokers"], 1: ["people smoke", "people are smokers"]}}}},
    4: {{"domain": "people", "value": {{0: ["do not smoke", "are non-smokers"], 1: ["smoke", "are smokers"]}}}},
    5: {{"value": {{0: ["the smoking rate decreases", "people stop smoking"], 1: ["the smoking rate increases", "people start smoking"]}}}},
    6: {{"value": {{0: ["For people that do not smoke", "Among non-smokers"], 1: ["For people that smoke", "Among smokers"]}}}},
    7: {{"value": {{0: ["people quite smoking", "people become non-smokers"], 1: ["people become smokers", "people take up smoking"]}}}},
  }},
  ...
}}
```

Answer concisely and precisely in the desired format, and only replace the blanks in curly braces. Do not add any additional comments or discussion. Most importantly, the verbalizations should not contain quantitative information like "often" or "rarely", and instead always assert the corresponding value.
